Hi,

Per the task instructions, I ended up taking a bare bones approach here due to limited availability. Initially, I was going to develop something rather more complete (with working DB, unit of work, controller, etc.), but on reviewing the task spec, that didn't seem to be requested. As such, I have included IRepository and associated tests. I have also opted not to include safety nets, e.g. if not found tests, etc., for simplicity, however, I would recommend including such safety mechanisms on production code.

Please let me know if you would like the application to be fleshed out into something more functional, e.g. including actual data layers, specific entities, etc.
